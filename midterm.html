  <h1> <a name="history"></a>History </h1>
  <hr>

  <h2><b> Founding </b></h2>
  <p> The New School for Social Research was founded by a group of professors and intellectuals in 1919 as a modern, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism" target="_self"> progressive</a>, free school where adult
    students could "seek an unbiased understanding of the existing order, its genesis, growth and present working."<sup><a href="#first">[3]</a></sup> Founders included economist and literary scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Saunders_Johnson" target="_self"> Alvin Johnson</a>, historian
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_A._Beard" target="_self"> Charles A. Bearch</a>, economists <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorstein_Veblen" target="_self"> Thorstein Veblen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harvey_Robinson" target="_self"> James Harvey Robinson</a>,
    and philosophers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Kallen" target="_self"> Horace M. Kallen</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dewey" target="_self"> John Dewey</a>. Several founders were former professors at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University" target="_self"> Columbia University</a>.</p>

  <p> In October 1917, after Columbia University imposed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_oath" target="_self"> loyalty oath</a> to the United States upon the entire faculty and student body, it fired several professors. Charles A. Beard, Professor of Political Science, resigned his professorship at Columbia in
    protest. His colleague James Harvey Robinson resigned in 1919 to join the faculty at the New School.</p>

  <p> The New School plan was to offer the rigorousness of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgraduate_education" target="_self"> postgraduate education</a> without degree matriculation or degree prerequisites. It was theoretically open to anyone, as the adult division today called Schools of Public Engagement remains. <sup><a href="#first">[4]</a></sup>
    The first classes at the New School took hte form of lectures followed by discussions, for larger groups, or as smaller conferences, for "those equipped for specific research." In the first semester, 100 courses, mostly in economics and politics, were offered by an ad hoc faculty that included <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Sewall_Adams" target="_self"> Thomas
      Sewall Adams</a>, Charles Beard, Horace M. Kallen, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Laski" target="_self"> Harold Laski</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Clair_Mitchell" target="_self"> Wesley Clair Mitchell</a>, Thorstein Veblen, James Harvey Robinson, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Wallas" target="_self">
        Graham Wallas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Davenport" target="_self"> Charles Davenport</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsie_Clews_Parsons" target="_self"> Elise Clews Parsons</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roscoe_Pound" target="_self"> Roscoe Pound</a>.<sup><a href="#first">[5]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage" target="_self"> John Cage</a>
        later pioneered the subject of Experimental Composition at the school.<sup><a href="#first">[6]</a></sup>

  <h2><b> University in Exile </b></h2>
  <p> The Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science was founded in 1933 as the University in Exile, to be a haven for scholars who had been dismissed from teaching positions by the Italian
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" target="_self"> facists</a> or had to flee <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" target="_self"> Nazi</a> Germany.<sup><a href="#first">[1][1]</a></sup> The University in Exile was initially founded by the director of the New School, Alvin Johnson, through the generous financial contributions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Halle" target="_self"> Hiram Hale</a>
    and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Foundation" target="_self"> Rockefeller Foundation</a>. It was renamed the "New School for Social Research" in 2005. The University in Exile and its subsequent incarnations have been the intellectual heart of the New School. Notable scholars associated with the University in Exile include psychologists
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm" target="_self"> Erich Fromm</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Wertheimer" target="_self"> Max Wertheimer</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Gurwitsch" target="_self"> Aron Gurwitsch</a>, political philosophers <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt" target="_self"> Hannah Arendt</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Strauss" target="_self"> Leo Strauss</a>, and philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Jonas" target="_self"> Hans Jonas</a>.</p>

  <p> Following the collapse of totalitarian regimes in Europe, the University in Exile was renamed the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science.</p>
  <p> In 2005 the Graduate Faculty was again renamed,this time taking the original name of the university, The New School for Social Research.</p>

  <h2><b> 2005 rebranding</b></h2>
  <p> In June 2005, the university was rebranded with a new logo and all schools were officially renamed to include "The New School" within their formal names.<sup><a href="#first">[2][3]</a></sup></p>
  <p> Some faculty, students, and alumni expressed concern over the rebranding of the university, especially the dramatic redesign of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo" target="_blank"> logo</a> from a six-sided
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield" target="_blank"> shield</a> against a green background to a spray-painted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti" target="_blank"> graffiti</a> mark reading simply, in capital letters, "THE NEW SCHOOL" with, in smaller letters beneath, "A UNIVERSITY." They claimed that the university's new identity
      campaign, while maintaining a slick urban edge, did little to suggest academic rigor or collegiate legacy.<sup><a href="#first">[4][5]</a></sup></p>
  <h2><b> 2015 rebranding</b></h2>
  <p> In 2015 the New School rebranded using elements designed by Paula Scher of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagram_(design_studio)" target="_blank"> Pentagram</a> using a bespoke font called "Neue".<sup><a href="#first">[6]</a></sup></p>
  <p> In addition to the new logo, the school announced that it was combining Mannes, Jazz, and Drama into a College of Performing Arts in fall 2015, relocating most of the performing arts to Arnhold Hall at 55 West 13th St., where the School of Jazz had occupied two floors since 1986.

  <h1> <a name="campus"></a>Campus</h1>
  <hr>
  <p> The New School's campus is composed of many buildings, most of which are minutes from Union Square.</p>
  <p> The university's Parsons division also has affiliations with schools that operate independently but embrace Parsons' philosophy and teaching methodology, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsons_Paris_(2013)" target="_self"> Parsons Paris</a>
    (France), India School of Design and Innovation (Mumbai, India), Parsons Shanghai (China), La Escuela de Diseno at
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altos_de_Chav%C3%B3n" target="_self"> Altos de Chavon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Romana,_Dominican_Republic" target="_self"> La Romana, Dominican Republic</a> and Kanazawa International Design Institute, Kanazawa (Japan).</p>
  <div class="caption" id="carrie">  <img id="alex" src="300px-Union_square_statue2.jpg" alt="This picture is not supported by your browser"> Union Sqaure, the location often referred to as New School's geographic "nucleus" </div>
  <p> The New School opened the 16-story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School_University_Center" target="_self"> University Center</a> at 65 5th Avenue in January 2014. The tower, which was designed by
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skidmore,_Owings_%26_Merrill"> Skidmore, Owings, and Merril</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Duffy"> Roger Duffy</a>, is the biggest capital project the university has ever undertaken.
    The building, added classrooms, new residences, and even facilities to the downtown New York City campus in addition to a library, and lecture hall. While the 65 Fifth Avenue plans were initially controversial among students and Village residents (spurring in 2009 a major student occupation was held at The New School's previous building on that site),
    plans for the University Center were adjusted in response to community concerns and have since been well received. In a review of the Universit Center's final design, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times"> <i> The New York Times</i></a> architecture critic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolai_Ouroussoff"> Nicolai Ouroussoff</a> called the building "a celebration of the cosmopolitan city."</p>

    <h2> Historical significance</h2>
    <p> Several of the university buildings are certified by New York City as historical landmarks. Prominent among these is the egg-shaped Tishman Auditorium, considered by many to be the first building to employ modern architecture. It was designed by architect
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Urban"> Josephy Urban</a>, along with the entirety of The New School's historic 66 West 12th Street building. Thousandsof writer's forums, author visits, political debates, award ceremonies, academic lectures, performances, and public hearings are held for both the academic community and general public throughout the year in Tishman.</p>

    <p> Newer buildings have garnered a multitude of awards. Among these is The Sheila Johnson Design Center, which attracted media attention for its revolutionary design. In 2009, it won the SCUP's Excellence in Architecture Renovation/Adaptive Reuse Award. In addition to being a Parsons core academic building, the Center also serves as a public art gallery. The New School Welcome Center, located on 13th Street and Fifth Avenue, won
      the American Institute of Architects, New York Chapter's Interiors Merit Award in 2010.</p>
